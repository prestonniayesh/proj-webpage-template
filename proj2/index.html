<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this assignment, we implemented a mesh rendering system. We Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision to create
    nice, smooth curves that can easily be adjusted by just moving the control points or adjusting the t parameter. We then
    extended this logic so that we could use this technique on 3D meshes. We learned the usefulness of the halfedge data structure,
    first through using it to implement smooth shading through area-weighted vertex normals. Finally, we implemented edge flips, and
    edge splits in order to perform loop subdivision for mesh upsampling, resulting in finer detailed meshes. It's interesting
    that all the detail we see in video games and movies comes down to how many times a mesh's triangles are divided. Combine that
    with nice shading, and the detail can become impeccable!

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive approach to determine the position of a point on a Bezier curve by utilizing
    repeated linear interpolation. The algorithm operates on a group of control points that outline the Bezier curve,
    and it assesses the point's position on the curve based on a specified parameter value.
    <br>
    The algorithm is pretty straightforward, so we iterated through the points array while comparing the point at index
    i with the point at index i+1, using the algorithm (lerp) on every such pair of points, adding it to a new array that we
    would return. The t value determined the weighting of each point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    To evaluate a point on a Bezier surface using De Casteljau's algorithm, we can modify the recursive process to
    operate on a grid of control points instead of a linear sequence. At each recursion depth, we compute the
    intermediate points along each row of the grid using linear interpolation, and then recursively call the function
    with the new set of control points and the next recursion depth until each row has been condensed into one linearly
    interpolated point. Then, we perform this same recursive process on the one column remaining after each row has been
    condensed to one point. When the recursion depth reaches 0, we return the single remaining point on the surface.

<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To compute the normal of a 3D vertex, we would use the cross product of the 2 edges subtending the angle formed by
    that vertex. Starting with vector v1 that corresponds to the vertex we are computing the normal of, the other 2
    vertices in the triangle are labelled v2 and v3. The edge going from v1 to v2 can be represented by v2 - v1, and the
    edge going from v1 to v3 is represented by v3 - v1 (we used halfedge()->next() and halfedge()->next()->next() for v2
    and v3 respectively). Once we have the 2 subtending edges we compute the cross product - cross(v2 - v1, v3 - v1) to
    get the normal vector.
    <br>
    We also need to weight by the area of the neighbors. The area of a triangle in 3D can also be computed using the
    cross product, normalizing it, and dividing by 2 (we found the formula online). We go through all the neighboring
    triangles of the starting vertex by using a do-while loop found in the primer, accumulating every area of a triangle
    multiplied by the normalized vector. Finally, we returned this accumulation (stored as result) and turned it into a
    unit vector.

        <img src="docs/images/part5/diagram.jpeg" align="middle" width="400px"/>
    </div>
    We had to create one new vertex (the center vertex that this method returned), three new edges, two new faces, and
    six new halfedges. We made sure to set e->isNew = true for e6 and e7 and e->isNew = false for e4, since e4 is just
    the second half of what used to be entirely e0.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Our debugging journey was mostly pertaining to edgeSplit() being called in task 6. We had to assign isNew booleans
    to the edges that were created, but of the 4 edges that were being changed/added (e0, e5, e6, e7), we weren’t sure
    whether we should consider e0 and e5 (the original splitting edge) to be a new edge or not. This made debugging a
    little bit frustrating because we would get an infinite loop when keeping e0 and e5 as old edges (which is actually
    correct), but it ended up being a minor change.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We used the 5-part pseudocode provided in the starter code to implement our subdivision algorithm. Part 1 was using
    the loop subdivision rule to compute the new vertex positions. We looped through all the neighbors in sequence to
    get an accumulation of neighborSum, and before that we used vertex->degree() to get the degree. This allowed us to
    use the formula v->newPosition = (1.0f - (float) n * u) * v->position + u * neighborSum and place it as the new
    position for every vertex.

    Part 2 was similar to part 1 except we were doing it for the edges. This was actually a little more complicated
    because we had some bugs in our code with regards to computing the correct vertex positions; here we used the
    formula as well. These two components set us up for doing the loop subdivision in parts 3 and 4.

    In parts 3 and 4 were splitting and flipping respectively. Something that we were having trouble with was deciding
    how many times we wanted to go through the mesh.edges array, since every split would effectively add to the array
    size, resulting in an infinite loop. We solved our issue by using a counter, and breaking the loop when counter
    reached the original array size. This worked because any new edges were appended to the end of the list of edges.
    For part 4 we flipped every edge that was new (e->isNew) and either had a previous vertex that was new with the
    next vertex being old, or vice versa. This was fairly straightforward as our code for tasks 4 and 5 were correct.
    Finally, we set the position of the vertex to the newPosition attribute in part 5.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    Sharp corners and edges remain protruding from the rest of the shape's smoothing even after subdivision. Sharp
    corners are usually created with halfedges forming a pentagon around the vertex. We can reduce this affect by
    splitting there of the edges going through this vertex to make the pentagon into a hexagon and skinnier. This results in the vertex not
    protruding as much. <br>
    Here are images of subdivision performed with no pre-splitting:

  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
    The reason why the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions is because each face of the cube
    only has one diagonal going through it originally. So when the subdivision occurs, this edge always remains, while
    other edges repeatedly become smaller through subdivision, making the original diagonal look stretched out in
    comparison. This can be fixed by splitting that diagonal originally so that there is an 'X' on each face of the cube
    instead of just a single diagonal. Now, both diagonals become "stretched" relative to all the other edges being
    created and split through subdivision, so the cube remains symmetric.<br>
