<p>To rasterize triangles, I:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Found the bounding box of the triangle through finding the minimum of the 3 x coordinates, the maximum of the 3
  x coordinates, the minimum of the 3 y coordinates, and the maximum of the 3 y coordinates.</li>
  <li>Iterated through all the points in the bounding box, and for each of those points:
    <ol>
      <li>Added (0.5, 0.5) to the point to align with this class's coordinate system.</li>
      <li>Calculated its barycentric coordinates based on the given triangle.</li>
      <li>Checked if the point's barycentric coordinates were all greater than or equal to 0. If this was true, I
      rasterized the point.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because I make sure
my loops only go through points inside the bounding box. Here is a screenshot of basic/test4.svg that demonstrates some
problematic jaggies:</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>For the supersampling algorithm, I:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Resized the sample buffer to size width * height * sample_rate.</li>
  <li>Iterated through all the points in the bounding box for rasterizing the triangles, and for each point:
    <ol>
      <li>Iterated through all the subpixels using two more loops that ran from x_step/y_step = 0 to sqrt(sample_rate).</li>
      <li>Instead of adding (0.5, 0.5) to each point, added ((x_step * 2 + 1) / (sqrt(sample_rate) * 2), (y_step * 2 + 1)
      / (sqrt(sample_rate) * 2) and performed the inside_triangle test.</li>
      <li>If inside_triangle, I rasterized the point, which filled the pixel/set sample_buffer[(y * ::sqrt(sample_rate) +
      y_step) * width * ::sqrt(sample_rate) + (x * ::sqrt(sample_rate) + x_step)]</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Performed a similar process for rasterizing lines, making sure to fill in all the subpixels with the same color.</li>
  <li>Transferred the color values from the sample buffer to the frame buffer by:
    <ol>
      <li>Iterating through each pixel in the sample buffer, and for each pixel iterating through each subpixel.</li>
      <li>Adding up all the color values together for each subpixel.</li>
      <li>Averaging them by dividing by the sample rate.</li>
      <li>Indexing into the frame buffer with the averaged value for each pixel.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Super sampling is useful because it gets rid of jaggies and makes the images much clearer from a distance by
introducing a gradual blur towards the edges in an image. I modified the rasterization pipeline by enlarging the sample
buffer, iterating through the subpixels and adding those color values into the sample bugger, and averaging down the
sample buffer subpixel color values to then add to the frame buffer. I used supersampling to antialias my triangles by
removing jaggies and replacing them with a gradual blur that looks much clearer and sharper from a distance. Here are
the compared effects: </p>

  <table style="width=100%">

      <td>

        <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate = 16.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>These results are observed because when you increase the super sampling rate, you can capture tiny parts of the pixel
that are inside the triangle and give that pixel a slight blur, and this blur will smoothly decrease as more of the pixel
is inside the triangle, resulting in a nice, sharp look from a distance.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are a way of representing a point within a triangle in terms of the ratios of the areas of
three smaller triangles that share the same vertices as the original triangle. The three smaller triangles are created
by connecting the point of interest to each of the vertices of the triangle. The barycentric coordinates are then the
ratios of the areas of these three smaller triangles to the total area of the original triangle.<br/><br/>

Given a triangle with vertices A, B, and C and a point P within the triangle, the barycentric
coordinates (α, β, γ) of P are the non-negative numbers that satisfy the following conditions:

<ul>
  <li>α + β + γ = 1</li>
  <li>αA + βB + γC = P</li>
</ul>

α represents the ratio of the area of triangle APB to the total area of triangle ABC, β represents the
ratio of the area of triangle BPC to the total area of triangle ABC, and γ represents the ratio of the area of triangle
CPA to the total area of triangle ABC. If a point has barycentric coordinates (α, β, γ), it means that it lies within
the triangle if and only if α, β, and γ are all non-negative.<br/><br/>

If we want to interpolate the color of triangle ABC where each of the three points has its own triangle, we can calculate
the barycentric coordinates for each point for each pixel inside the triangle, and assign its color to be a weighted
combination of each of the color of the 3 bounding points, weighted by the ratios given by the barycentric coordinates.</p>

<p>Let's say that the triangle has vertices A, B, and C with colors (R1, G1, B1), (R2, G2, B2), and (R3, G3, B3)
  respectively. Let (α, β, γ) be the barycentric coordinates of a point P within the triangle. Then, the color of point
  P can be calculated as:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>R = α * R1 + β * R2 + γ * R3</li>
    <li>G = α * G1 + β * G2 + γ * G3</li>
    <li>B = α * B1 + β * B2 + γ * B3</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>In other words, the red component of the color at point P is equal to the weighted average of the red components of
the colors at vertices A, B, and C, where the weights are given by the barycentric coordinates α, β, and γ. Similarly,
the green and blue components of the color at point P are calculated as weighted averages of the green and blue
components at the vertices. This interpolation method gives a smooth color transition across the triangle, with the
colors at the vertices being blended together in a way that depends on the location of the point within the triangle.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Pixel sampling consists of mapping a screen pixel to a location on a texture map for its color values using sampling
methods. I implemented nearest pixel sampling and bilinear interpolation for texture mapping. In nearest pixel sampling,
the color value of the pixel on the texture map that is closest to the pixel in the  screen space is used based on the given uv coordinates. In bilinear
interpolation, the color values of the four closest pixels on the texture map are used  in a weighted average to
determine the screen pixel color, where the weights are determined by the screen pixel's distance to each of the four
points on the texture map, computed through bilinear interpolation. To implement this, I:
<ol>
  <li>Calculated the colors of the 4 surrounding pixels of the point of interest.</li>
  <li>Performed linear interpolation on the x-axes for the colors of the top 2 pixels and the bottom 2 pixels, weighing
    each color by its distance to the point of interest on the x-axis.</li>
  <li>Performed linear interpolation on the y-axes for the 2 colors interpolated above based on the weighted average
  of their distances in a similar manner.</li>
</ol>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<br/>
As you can see in the sample rate = 1 examples, bilinear interpolation forms the white lines in a much smoother manner
than the jaggies produced by nearest pixel sampling. This effect is also evident when sample rate = 16, where nearest
pixel sampling still produces some jaggies, and bilinear interpolation introduces a smoothing that looks much better.
The difference between nearest pixel sampling and bilinear interpolation is most noticeable when the texture being
sampled has a high degree of variability and the objects being textured are viewed up close.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>Level sampling is a technique used in texture mapping to determine the color or other properties of a texture at a
specific point on a surface. It involves selecting the mipmap level that best matches the size of the texel (texture
element) being sampled, to minimize distortion or blurring.<br>
We used level sampling in 3 different cases, L_ZERO, L_NEAREST, and L_LINEAR. L_ZERO was the base case where no level
sampling was needed, because the level was set at 0. L_NEAREST involved us having to first compute the mipmap level and
round it to the nearest integer. For L_LINEAR we didn’t round it to the nearest integer - rather we computed the
textColor for the upper and lower mipmap levels and weighted them based on how far the level is from each. For both
L_LINEAR and L_NEAREST we had to use the level calculation formula given in lecture 5 slide 85.<br>
While comparing the different sampling levels, methods, and pixel sampling, we saw that they all roughly took the same
amount of time, with increased sampling level being slightly slower for detailed images. Nearest level sampling requires
less memory than linear sampling since it only needs to store the mipmap levels, which are smaller in size compared to
the original texture. However, it may not produce smooth results when the texture is magnified or minified, and this is
a trade-off between nearest level and linear.<br>
Pixel sampling also tends to struggle with antialiasing artifacts that may come up. This is where the number of samples
comes in. Using the weighted average we are able to reduce aliasing artifacts and produce smoother results. However, the
time taken and memory used take a hit.<br>
Level sampling also takes more memory than pixel sampling (albeit not much of a difference for us) but the antialiasing
power is stronger and less memory is used.
