    <div class="padded">

        
        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).

        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>We did parts 2 and 4 for this project. Our main approach for part 2 was to use the formulas provided along with the helper functions to calculate the relevant microfacet BRDF, NDF, and BRDF sampled values. Some calculations were fairly complicated, especially when we realized that there were differences between trig functions like cos() and cos_theta(). For sample_f we realized that we could generate the wi vector as a linear combination of wo and h. Something we struggled with was placing the necessary value checks in the correct functions, but overall it was not a challenge. For part 4 we used our code from 3-1 part 1 as a basis for changing to camera space. The difference here was creating pLens and pFocus to generate a new dir vector. This allows the created ray to receive radiance from the uniform sampling of the thin lens.
            <br>
            We worked together for the entire project in a pair programming environment. We also completed the writeup together and it was successful. We learnt a great deal about the differences between thin lens and pinhole as well as more stuff about sampling.

            When alpha = 0.005, the material is super reflective like metal. The dragon has a dark coloring for the most part, but you can see some of the gold in the dragon.
            When alpha = 0.05, the dragon is similar to the previous, except now it is a bit shinier, and more reflective of light.
            When alpha = 0.25, the dragon is a lot shinier and not as reflective of the surroundings. The color is a much lighter gold for the most part.
            When alpha = 0.5, the dragon is super bright and gold, and hardly reflective of the surrounding walls.

        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!
        </b>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            A pinhole camera differs from a thin-lens camera in the sense that it takes all light incident on the lens into focus, instead of just one point line a pinhole camera does. With a thin lens, light is refracted onto the point. Furthermore a point receives radiance not just from the origin but from any point on the thin-lens. Because of this, we uniformly sample the lens to obtain the radiance. This is why the depth-of-field effect is generated by a thin-lens rather than a pinhole.
